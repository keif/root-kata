# Root Code Kata
Describe your approach to solving the problem.

Email your code to us as a tarball (tar zcvf your-code.tgz your-code-dir) or a gitbundle (GIT_DIR=your-code-dir/.git git bundle create your-code.gitbundle --all). We use GMail for our email at Root, and it will block email attachments of tarballs that contain .jar or .js files. If you implemented your solution in Java or Javascript and are sending us a tarball, please rename the attachment with an arbitrary extension (e.g. your-code.tarball) to get it through GMail's filters.

##Problem Statement

The code will process an input file. In my case, utilizing `node` using webpack and fs.

Execution by node `main.js /path/to/input.txt`

Two Commands:
Driver
Trip

###Driver
Registers a Driver

###Trip
Registers a trip

NOTES:
Discard any trips that average a speed of less than 5 mph or greater than 100 mph.

Generate a report containing each driver with total miles driven and average speed.

Sort the output by most miles driven to least.

Round miles and miles per hour to the nearest integer.

Example input:

Driver Dan
Driver Alex
Driver Bob
Trip Dan 07:15 07:45 17.3
Trip Dan 06:12 06:32 21.8
Trip Alex 12:01 13:16 42.0

Expected output:

Alex: 42 miles @ 34 mph
Dan: 39 miles @ 47 mph
Bob: 0 miles

### To Execute

From the build directory:
Do to the use of `async` you need a node version no earlier than `v7.6`.

To match my build environment, you'll need `v11.6.0`

If you require an earlier build of Node.JS I do recommend Node Version Manager to switch between node versions.

This project was build with the "stable" branch of node 
`node main.js data.txt`
